# ChatNova
Developed a cloud-native conversational AI web app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) integrated with external AI APIs for intelligent, real-time responses.

Designed and implemented backend APIs, database integration, and responsive frontend components (chat window, sidebar, loaders) with secure environment variable management.

Deployed on AWS EC2 with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, YAML automation) ensuring automated testing (Jest), reliable deployments, and scalable cloud infrastructure.
